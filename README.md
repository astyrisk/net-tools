Custom Net-Tools

This repository contains simple versions of standard Linux networking tools, all written from scratch in C. 

Each program is a learning project, focusing on a core networking concept:

- ping: The first and simplest tool. It checks if a host is online by sending a packet and waiting for a reply. 
- scan: A simple port scanner that checks for open ports on a target server. 
- echo-server: A pair of programs (a client and a server) that send messages back and forth. 
- trace: This tool maps the path a packet takes to get to its destination. 
- http-client: A simple program that connects to a website, requests a page, and prints the result.
